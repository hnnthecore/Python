# Python Learning Path 🐍

This repository contains my personal learning journey with the Python programming language.  
It's a structured collection of exercises, categorized by topic and ordered by difficulty.

## 📂 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a main topic (e.g. variables, conditions, data structures).  
Inside each folder, exercises are numbered and named for clarity:


## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Variables and data types (int, float, str, bool)
- Type conversions and input handling
- Math operations and string formatting
- Conditional logic (if, elif, else)
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets)
- Mini projects (coming soon...)

## 🚀 Goal

Build a solid Python foundation by completing and organizing:
- Fundamental theory-based exercises
- 100+ mini projects (planned)

All code is commented in English to follow best practices and stay consistent for international use.

## 💡 Note

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated continuously as I learn more!
